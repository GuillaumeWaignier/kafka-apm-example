Example of APM for Kafka


# Architecture of collect

![kafka-apm-example](doc/kafka-apm-example-archi.png "Architecture")

Trace are sent by [OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation) 
into an [OpenTemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector).
The collector send traces inside a Kafka topic named _otlp_spans_.
You can see this topic with AKHQ at [http://localhost:8080/ui/docker-kafka-server/topic/oltp_spans/data](http://localhost:8080/ui/docker-kafka-server/topic/oltp_spans/data).

Then a second OpenTelemetry collector consumes the trace from Kafka and send them inside two different tools.
* One is the [Elastic APM](https://www.elastic.co/fr/apm). You can find the result at [http://localhost:5601/app/apm/services?rangeFrom=now-15m&rangeTo=now](http://localhost:5601/app/apm/services?rangeFrom=now-15m&rangeTo=now)
* The other is [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/). You can find the result at [http://localhost:16686/search](http://localhost:16686/search).

# Test with simple kafka producer/consumer

![kafka-apm-example](doc/kafka-apm-example-exemple-simple.png "Simple")

In this first test, a Kafka producer sends traces inside a topic named _test1_ and 2 consumers consume the traces.

A stateless KSQL query consumes also the same topic
```sql
CREATE STREAM json(id VARCHAR) WITH(VALUE_FORMAT='DELIMITED', KAFKA_TOPIC='test1');
CREATE STREAM test_json_ksql WITH(VALUE_FORMAT='json') AS SELECT * FROM json;
```
![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-jaeger-simple.png "Simple jaeger")

With Jaeger, we can trace the records between producer and consumer.
However, the trace is lost after the KSQL process.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-elastic-simple.png "Simple jaeger")

We have the same with elastic.

# Test with API


![kafka-apm-example](doc/kafka-apm-example-exemple-api.png "Simple")

In this example, the kafka's records are sent with a REST API.
The consumption is the same as previous example.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-jaeger-api.png "Simple jaeger")

With Jaeger, we see the trace between the POST REST api call and the production into kafka topic.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-elastic-api.png "Simple jaeger")

The same with elastic.

# Test with a stateless kstream

![kafka-apm-example](doc/kafka-apm-example-kstream-stateless.png "Architecture")

A Producer sends traces inside a Kafka topic named _test3_.
A stateless kafka kstream (a simple _map_) convert the string record into json record and produces them inside a topic named _test_json_kstream_stateless_.
A kafka connect (connector Elasticsearch) consumes this topic and send records inside Elasticsearch.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-jaeger-map.png "Simple jaeger")

With Jaeger, we follow the traces through the kafka stream.
We can also see the consumption by kafka connect.
However, we cannot see the indexation inside Elasticsearch.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-elastic-map.png "Simple jaeger")

The same with elastic.

# Test with a statefull (join) kstream

![kafka-apm-example](doc/kafka-apm-example-kstream-statefull.png "Architecture")

A Producer1 sends traces inside a Kafka topic named _test1_.
A second Producer2 sends traces inside a Kafka topic named _test2_.

A statefull kafka kstream joins the topic _test2_ (a KStream) with the _topic1_ (a KTable).
The result is produced into a topic named _test_json_kstream_statefullJoin_.
A kafka connect (connector Elasticsearch) consumes this topic and send records inside Elasticsearch.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-jaeger-join.png "Simple jaeger")

With Jaeger, we follow the traces that come from _topic2_ through the kafka stream topology.
We can also see the consumption by kafka connect.
However, we cannot see the indexation inside Elasticsearch.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/apm-elastic-join.png "Simple jaeger")

The same with elastic.

# Test with angular front

![kafka-apm-example](doc/kafka-apm-example-front.png "Architecture")

A Producer1 sends traces inside a Kafka topic named _test1_.
A user uses the front [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to call a [AKHQ](http://localhost:8080) API that produce message into Kafka topic named _test2_.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/trace-front.png "trace")

We can see the full trace from the front to kafka connect.
We can also link with the log produce in the backend.

![kafka-apm-example](doc/log.png "log")

And the real user experience

# Join Invoice and Payment

In a topic _document_ create records as:

For Invoice
```json
{"clientId": "123", "documentId": "i1", "type":"invoice"}
```

For Payment
```json
{"clientId": "123", "documentId": "p1", "type":"payment"}
```
